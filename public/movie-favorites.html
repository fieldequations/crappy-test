<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>

<h2>My top three movies as of the moment.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Apartment</h3>
<p>There's nothing wasted in this movie. Even the leftover bottle of champagne from the beginning of the movie ties in to the ending.</p>
<h3>The Life of Brian</h3>
<p>Technically just a pastiche of sketches written by six different writers, but the whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts. Best grammar scene of all time.</p>
<h3>Notorious</h3>
<p>The emotional struggle between the two protagonists weaves through the real physical danger the heroine faces. And black and white cinematography never looked so gorgeous.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
<p>Persona</p>
<p>Rear Window</p>
<P>Nosferatu</P>
<p>Blade Runner</p>

<p>Modern Times</p>
<p>The General</p>
<p>Lat den ratta komma in</p>
